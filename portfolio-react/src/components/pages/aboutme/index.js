                        While I was in highschool I took some tech courses of
                        coding in Visual Fox Pro and Visual Basic, helping my
                        classmates to type, fix and run their code was fun. I
                        remember coding little desktop apps connected with local
                        databases, back then that was mind blowing for me. That
                        got me wondering.. How would it be working as a
                        developer? And here I am.
